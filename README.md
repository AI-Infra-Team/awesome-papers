## Presentation Methodology: Lightning Talk

A lightning talk is a very short presentation, typically 3 to 5 minutes long, that gets straight to the point to share an idea, a research summary, or a key finding. The goal is to efficiently deliver core messages, spark conversations, and encourage collaboration without going into excessive detail. These talks often use a minimal number of slides and are usually delivered consecutively with other speakers in a single session.

Key characteristics:
- Length: Short, usually 3–5 minutes, though sometimes up to 7 or 15 minutes depending on the event.
- Focus: Concentrates on 2-3 key points or a single big-picture idea rather than a detailed overview.
- Format: Typically includes a few slides (e.g., 3-5), but some formats might specify only one.
- Purpose: Designed to be concise, engaging, and to inspire future discussions and collaborations.
- Delivery: Encourages presenters to have a strong opening ("hook") and a clear, memorable takeaway, often using visuals over text.
